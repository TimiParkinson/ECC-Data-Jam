## Problem:
How do factors like Pell Grant share, parental income, endowment per student, and other financial indicators impact the economic accessibility of California universities for students?

## Why is it Important?:
This topic aims to understand how universities in California vary in terms of economic accessibility. The research highlights economic accessibility and gaps in higher education, aiding students in making informed decisions about post-secondary institutions.Our analysis will shed light on how institutions support students across different income levels by examining factors like Pell Grant shares, parental income distribution, and endowment per student, etc. Moreover, this research can challenge common perceptions about public/private universities and contribute to a deeper public understanding about the colleges in California. 

## Hypothesis(To be finalized):
  ### Pell Grant Share and Income Level:
    Hypothesis: Universities with a higher Pell Grant share serve a significantly larger proportion of lower-income students compared to universities with a lower Pell Grant share.
    Test: Compare the income levels of students at institutions with varying Pell Grant shares.
  ### Endowment Per Student and Net Price:
    Hypothesis: There is a significant negative correlation between endowment per student and net price for mid-income students.
    Test: Use correlation analysis to assess the relationship between endowment per student and net prices.
  ### Type of Institution and Economic Accessibility:
    Hypothesis: Public universities have a significantly higher Pell Grant share than private universities.
    Test: Compare the Pell Grant shares between public and private institutions.
